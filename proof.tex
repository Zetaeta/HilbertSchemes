\begin{document}

\begin{thm} Let $I \subset R := \C[x,y,z]$ is an ideal generated by monomials of the form $x^iz^j$ and $y^iz^j$
such that $R/I$ is a vector space of dimension $d$. Then $\dim_\C \Hom_R(I,R/I)=3d$
\end{thm}
$Hom(I,R/I)$ is generated by those morphisms that send the canonical generators of $I$ to monomials in $R/I$.
These morphisms can be represented as a collection of arrows in the 3 dimensional Young diagram made up of the set $S$ of monomials in $R/I$
with tails at the generators and heads at some block inside the diagram.
The map $f$ represented by such a collection of arrows is an $R-$morphism iff for any generators $\alpha,\beta$ such that $m\alpha=n\beta$, $mf(\alpha)=nf(\beta) \in R/I$.
This is satisfied when if some arrow of $f$, any arrows obtained by dragging that arrow block by block until its tail is at a different generator
while keeping its head inside $S$ and tail outside are also part of $f$, and there are no arrows that
can be dragged in this manner until their head lies below the bounds of the diagram (i.e. has negative powers of some variable).
We may assume that such a dragging happens along the boundary keeping the tail directly or diagonally adjacent to a block in $S$.

We may thus consider only morphisms where every arrow is equal in length and direction and any arrow can be dragged as described to any other.
Label the canonical generators in two groups: $\alpha_0=z^p$ downwards in the $xz$ plane to $\alpha_m=x^q$, $\beta_0=\alpha_0$ downwards in the $yz$ plane to $\beta_o=y^r$. 
The absence of generators containing nonzero powers of x and y means that if we take the z axis to be vertical, each horizontal layer of blocks in the diagram is rectangular.
There are three types of arrows possible: firstly those arrows from the generators $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_m$ with heads having higher or equal powers of $z$,
secondly arrows from the generators $\beta_1, \dots, \beta_o$ with the same condition,
and thirdly all arrows from any generators (except $\alpha_m$, $\beta_o$) with heads having smaller powers of $z$.

Consider the first class of arrows.
For each $\alpha_i$, $i=1, \dots, n$ let us count the morphisms $f$ consisting of these arrows such such that $f(\alpha_i) \neq 0$ and $f(\alpha_j)=0$ for $j<i$.
Let $p_i$ be the vertical distance from $\alpha_i$ to $\alpha_{i-1}$, and $q_i$ be such that $y^{q_i-1}\alpha_i/x \notin I$ but $y^{q_i}\alpha_i/x \in I$,
i.e. the distance in the $y$ direction from $\alpha_i$ along the edge of the diagram. $f(\alpha_{i-1})=0$ means that we cannot drag the arrow at $\alpha_i$ to $\alpha_{i-1}$,
therefore $z^{p_i}f(\alpha_i) \in I$. Such an arrow cannot be dragged to any generator $\beta_j$: 
$f(\alpha_i)$ has higher or equal powers of $z$ and $y$ than $\alpha_i$ (as $y \nmid \alpha_i$) so must have a lower power of $x$. Thus $f(\alpha_i)=y^bz^c\alpha_i/x^a$,
and dragging the arrow will produce arrows with tails at $m \in I$ and heads at $my^bz^c/x^a$. For any such arrow, $my^bz^c/x^a \in S \implies m/x^a \in S$.
The intersection of the horizontal layer containing $m$ with $S$ is rectangular and the tail of these arrows will thus always be found some power of $x$ beyond this rectangle
so cannot be dragged around to any $\beta_i$ on the $y$ side.

The head of the arrow has not smaller powers of $y$ and $z$ and $\alpha_j$ has higher powers of $x$ than $\alpha_i$ for $j>i$,
so dragging the arrow to these $\alpha_j$ cannot push the head below the diagram.
Therefore each arrow from $\alpha_i$ to some element of $S$ with a not lower power of $z$ that is at most $p_i$ blocks below the surface of the diagram
defines a distinct morphism that is zero on each $\alpha_j, j<i$ and on all $\beta_j$.
The number of these arrows is the same as the number of boxes in $S$ contained in the height interval from $\alpha_i$ to $\alpha_{i-1}$,
i.e. those whose powers of $z$ range from $a$ to $a+p_i-1$ if $a$ is the power of $z$ in $\alpha_i$.
Counting these boxes means that every box will be counted exactly once when we count $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_m$, giving $d$ morphisms of this type.

Morphisms corresponding to the second class of arrows are counted the same way interchanging $x$ and $y$, giving $d$ of them.

For each generator (except $\alpha_m, \beta_r$) we count morphisms of this type which take that generator to an element of $S$ and all generators with lower powers of $z$ to zero.
\begin{lmm} If an arrow of this type cannot be dragged to some lower generator directly (i.e. without dragging it upwards then down), then it cannot be dragged to a lower generator in any manner.
\end{lmm}
Suppose we have such an arrow at a generator $\alpha$ that can be dragged indirectly to a lower generator $\beta$.
If we call the highest power of $z$ appearing in the tail of any intermediate arrows along the path the height of the path,
then there exists a path from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ of least height. If this height is that of $\alpha$ then we are done.
If not, we may assume that the tail is dragged up to that height in one direction (assume negative $x$ direction) and down from it in the other (negative $y$),
as otherwise this part of the path is redundant and the path could be shortened to one unit lower. Let $m_1$ and $m_2$ be the first and last values the tail takes
at this height. Then $m_1/(xz)$ and $m_2/(yz)$ appear on the edges of a rectangular layer of the diagram, and we may assume the path travels
directly upwards to (downwards from) $m1$ ($m_2$) from (to) the horizontal face of the diagram immediately below it.
Let $m_0$ ($m_3$) be the beginning (end) of this vertical transit. Assume WLOG that $m_0$ is higher, then let $m_4$ be the block of the downward vertical path
in the layer containing $m_0$. The intersection of $S$ with that layer is a rectangle with $m_0$ and $m_4$ immediately beside its borders,
and we may drag the arrow around the border of that rectangle using the fact that the heads of the arrows from $m_0$, $m_4$ are in a single rectangular layer.
This gives us a path of lower height.


Thus for each generator $\alpha$, the morphisms we are counting correspond to arrows downward from $\alpha$ that cannot be dragged any farther down.
There are two cases to consider: Either $\alpha$ is the only generator at its height, or there is one other generator $\beta$ found on the opposite corner of that layer.
In the first case, the upward-facing surface of the layer below $\alpha$ (those elements $m$ of $S$ with power of $z$ one less than $\alpha$ satisfying $zm \in I$)
is rectangular of $x-$length $\xi$ and $y-$length $\eta$, and arrows can be dragged downward in either the $x$ or $y$ direction.
Then arrows that cannot be dragged farther down are those for which $x^{\xi}f(\alpha) \in I$ and $y^\eta f(\alpha) \in I$,
which by the rectangular nature of layers of $S$ are precisely arrows with heads in the $\xi \times \eta$ rectangle of their layer of $S$
found immediately inwards of that layer's far corner, for any layer below $\alpha$. This is the same as counting the number of boxes found
directly below the rectangular surface under $\alpha$.

In the second case, assume $\alpha = \alpha_i$ and $\beta=\beta_j$ for some $i,j$. To count the morphisms we are interested in from this layer,
we first count those that take $\alpha$ to $S$ and then those taking $\alpha$ to zero but $\beta$ to $S$.
Let $p$ be the distance in the $x$ direction from $\alpha_i$ to $\alpha_{i+1}$, and $q$ be minimal such that  $y^{q}\alpha/z \in I$,
let $r$ be the distance in the $y$ direction from $\beta$ to $\alpha$, and let $s$ be the distance in the $x$ direction from $\beta_j$ to $\beta_{j+1}$.
Then the upward-facing surface of the layer below $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is the disjoint union of a $p \times q$ rectangle and a $r \times s$ one.
By the same argument as the previous case, arrows taking $\beta$ to $S$ that cannot be dragged downwards are those with heads that lie in the
cornermost $p \times q$ rectangle of their layer of $S$.
The arrows taking $\alpha$ to zero are arrows from $\beta$ that can be dragged neither downwards nor to have their tail at $\alpha$.
Arrows for which $x^rf(\beta) \in S$ can be dragged to $\beta$, so these arrows we count are those with heads that lie in
the cornermost $r \times s$ rectangle of their layer of $S$. Therefore the total number of morphisms counted for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is
the number of boxes in the upward-facing surface under $\alpha,\beta$ in each layer below them, which is the number of blocks in $S$ found directly below this surface.

So the total count of the morphisms with type three arrows is obtained by counting for every upward-facing surface of $S$ all the blocks below that surface,
which will count every block of $S$ exactly once, giving $d$ morphisms.

Therefore $\dim_\C \Hom_R(I,R/I)=d+d+d=3d$
